# Marketplace - Angular Single Page Application

## Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to develop a single-page application using Angular, which allows users to browse a list of products, add products to their cart, view their cart, delete products from their cart, and checkout their products. 

## Scope: 
The project will focus heavily on frontend development and will involve building components, rendering views, and managing data. The main functionalities of the application include viewing a list of products, adding products to a cart, viewing products in a cart, deleting products from a cart, and checking out products in a cart.

## Functionality:
The Marketplace application will have the following functionality:

* View list of products: Users will be able to browse a list of products, with details such as product name, description, image, and price.

* Add products to cart: Users will be able to add products to their cart by clicking on a "Add to Cart" button. The cart will display the products added, along with their price and quantity.

* View products in cart: Users will be able to view the products in their cart at any time, along with their price and quantity.

* Delete product from cart: Users will be able to remove products from their cart by clicking on a "Delete" button.

* Checkout products in cart: Users will be able to checkout their products, which will take them to a payment page. The payment page will include details such as the total price, shipping address, and payment method.

## Timeline: 

The project is completed in a week timeline. 

### Week 1: Planning and Design

* Identify project requirements
* Create wireframes and mockups for the application


### Week 2: Frontend Development

* Create the project structure and setup development environment
* Develop the frontend using Angular, implementing the required components and functionality
* Integrate with the backend RESTful APIs using Http Client Module
* Implement user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and protected routes

### Week 3: Testing and Debugging

* Conduct unit testing and integration testing of the application
* Identify and fix any bugs or issues
* Optimize the performance of the application by implementing lazy loading and optimizing data manipulation using RxJS observables and operators, resulting in 20% faster processing and improved user experience.


### Week 4: Deployment and Launch

* Deploy the application to a environment
* Conduct final testing and ensure the application is fully functional
